<div class="shead">PROCEDURAL STEPS:</div>
<div class="nob">
<p>Valve V<sub>1</sub> - Buchholz Relay to transformer tank<br /> Valve V<sub>2</sub> - Conservator to Buchholaz Relay<br /> Valve V<sub>3</sub> - Reservoir to Transformer Tank<br /> Valve V<sub>4</sub> - Oil release in the Buchholaz Relay (left side)<br /> Valve V<sub>5</sub> - Air release in the Buchholaz Relay(right side)</p>
</div>
<div class="nob"><ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Keep all the front panel switches in OFF condition.</li>
<li>If any pressure is present in the relay, release it first by using Valve V<sub>5</sub> and also use the hand valve which is present on the reservoir to release the pressure from the remaining part.</li>
<li>Close all Valves except V<sub>2.</sub></li>
<li>Fill the oil in the buchholz relay by using foot pump by little opening of the Valve V<sub>5</sub> (only if air lock is present in the relay).</li>
<li>Switch ON the power supply.</li>
<li>Switch ON the buzzer toggle switch.</li>
<li>Open the Valve V<sub>1</sub> slightly and decrease the oil level manually below the particular level by carefully seeing the oil level in the buchholz relay. Now the alarm contact will be closed and the buzzer will operate in control panel.</li>
<li>After getting the alarm indication, close the Valve V<sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li>First release the Valve V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> and collect the oil into the resevoir then follow the steps 2-8 once again.</li>
<li>After completion of experiment open all the Valves including hand Valve except V<sub>4</sub> and V<sub>5</sub> to release the air pressure inside all the tanks.</li>
