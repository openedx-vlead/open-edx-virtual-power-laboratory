<div class="shead">DETERMINATION OF X1 (Positive Sequence reactance): &ndash;</div>
<div class="nob">
<p>It is a reactance of a synchronous machine under steady state condition in the direct axis. The positive sequence impedance can also be defined as the impedance offered by the machine to the flow of positive sequence currents in the armature windings create a magnetic field that rotates in the normal direction in the air gap.</p>
