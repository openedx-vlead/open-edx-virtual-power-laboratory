<div class="shead">PROCEDURAL STEPS</div>
<p></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Place the High Voltage transformer unit about 7ï¿½ away from the central unit.</li>
<li>The central unit is connected to supply voltage taking care that the earth connections are effective.</li>
<li>The multiple point control switch is set at its lowest tapping. </li>
<li>The push button on control unit is pressed firmly for at least 5 seconds. Note that no Breakdown to occurs, in which case button should be released at once without delay. Break down is indicated by a continuous discharge across the gap, bubbling of oil in the cell and meter indicating a sudden voltage drop.</li>
